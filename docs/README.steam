[h2]Change orientation[/h2]

By default, the Jump Gate or Accelerator will be oriented from "South" to "North" for the current map orientation.
It is mean, that you will "enter" the object from "South" to "North". But exiting the opposite object will be from "North" to "South".

So, if you want to make a route more effective, please orient the Gates/Accelerators accordingly, i.e. to have the "entrance" in the direction of the destination sector. From both sides of the connection.

Please take in account, that the orientation is dependent on the current map orientation. By default, the map orientation is "South" to "North", i.e. "South" is at the bottom of the map and "North" is at the top of the map.
I.e. if you want to build the object oriented from "West" to "East", i.e. target sector is on a right hand for current, you need to rotate the map to have "West" at the bottom of the map (for source sector).
And make it opposite for the target sector, i.e. rotate the map to have "East" at the bottom of the map.
All of these is valid if you place the object in the closest border to opposite sector.

To reset map orientation, please use the '.' hotkey to focus map on your current position. In this case orientation will be "South" to "North" for a whole map.

[h2]Mod Options[/h2]
